Creative Tim UI is a comprehensive component library and custom registry built on top of [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) to help you build beautiful, modern web applications faster. It provides pre-built, customizable React components and blocks designed for production-ready applications.

## Installation

Components are available via the `@creative-tim/npm-xyz` command.

```bash
npx @creative-tim/npm-xyz@latest components add <component>
```

For example, to install a button component, you can run:

```bash
npx @creative-tim/npm-xyz@latest components add button
```

Alternatively, you can use the standard shadcn CLI:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://creative-tim.com/ui/r/<component>.json
```

## Credits

Creative Tim UI is built upon the incredible work of the open source community:

- **[shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)** - The documentation structure, registry system, and foundational (atomic) components are adapted from the open source work in shadcn/ui
- **[Material Tailwind](https://material-tailwind.com/v3)** by Creative Tim - The blocks and component designs are inspired by and based on Material Tailwind Framework
- **[Eleven Labs UI](https://github.com/elevenlabs/elevenlabs-ui)** - General inspiration for the documentation structure and approach
- **[Geist Font](https://vercel.com/font)** by Vercel - The beautiful typeface used throughout the interface

We are grateful to these projects for making their work available under open source licenses.
